# asyncVSmmkv

**HOW TO USE**

In order to use useAsyncStorage hook with either mmkv or asyncStorage and check for performance in your react native app and decide what suits it, kindly install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage, recoil and react-native-mmkv in your react native application. While you test out how useAsyncStorage performs when either of the storage is being used.

You are free to merge to main incase their is any improvement.

Thanks
